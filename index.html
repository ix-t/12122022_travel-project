            <h2>Why Mexico City?</h2>
            <h3>Mexico City, the city of Palaces</h3>
            <p>
              Mexico City is the capital city of the United States of Mexico,
              the official name of the country. It is located in the Federal
              District, the entire area of which it encompasses, and is often
              referred to as Mexico City or even simply as DF (Distrito
              Federal). Mexico City is the largest city in North America, whose
              size and population make it comparable only to cities such as
              Tokyo, Japan, or Moscow, Russia. It is one of the largest cities
              in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is the main urban, social, political, academic, economic,
              tourist, artistic, business and cultural center of the Mexican
              nation, and has been the scene of numerous important events in the
              life and history of the nation. It is where the political power
              resides and is also the cradle of Mexico's rich and vast
              pre-Columbian history.

            <p>
              Mexico City was founded as such by the Aztecs (Mexica Empire)
              under the name of Mexico-Tenochtitlan, settling in the vicinity of
              ancient settlements in the area around the 14th century.
